        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My mission in life and that I will carry on in my workplace is to give every bit of effort I can to 
help a group or myself succeed. I have many skills that stem from prior experiences in my life 
that have made me want better for myself and the people around me. I want to grow as a problem 
solver and work to better myself in team-oriented projects to help increase my capacity in 
workplace. Wanting to pursue management makes me to want to learn as much as I can about 
different positions in my workplace, which will in turn help the people around me. I want people 
to remember me as someone who worked hard and was helpful to everyone around me.</p>
